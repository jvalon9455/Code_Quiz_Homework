# Code_Quiz_Homework

## DESCRIPTION

The point of this exercise was to showcase how much you have learned this past week using JavaScript.
This past week we learned about using variables, arrays, and how to traverse the DOM.

In the code quiz the user is suppose to answer a series of questions in a certain time limit. If the user gets the answer wrong, they will be deducted 10 seconds from the current time. 

At the end of the quiz, they are to log their score and try again if they so choose.

# WHAT I LEARNED

This week I learned that I need to have a better game plan at executing this type of assignment. There were a lot of moving parts, and unfortunately I did not get as much done as I would have liked. However, I am proud for far I have come since the start of this class.
